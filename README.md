# Wildlife-Test
It is simple Python program with a GUI built using tkinter that tests your knowledge of identifying species. Inspired by a course I took in the university where I learnt to identify species but forgot most of them. Currently, bird species found in Ontario are available in the Images directory.

I'm also using this to learn and play around with repositories. You can contribute to this if you happen to stumble upon it. If you're a beginner, this should be a good project for you to contribute to.

# How It Works
Images are saved in the "Images" directory with each species having its own subdirectory. The program determines the name of the species based on the name of the subdirectory where the images are contained, so make sure to double check the spelling of the name. 

To play, run wildlife_test.py. Capitalization does not matter for answers. You can also use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to go through your previously submitted answers (if the same species shows up twice in a row let's say, then you can press Up Arrow instead of typing its name all over again).

# Known Issues
- The test ends 1 too early (e.g. if there are 9 images in total then it will end on 8 and show your score out of 8).
- download_species_images.py is broken due to the package, google_images_download, being broken

# To Do
- Center the widgets on the window and make sure they remain centered if window is resized.
- Display the name of species when Skip is pressed so you can learn the name of the species you didn't know
- Add species categories (e.g. birds, reptiles, mammals, etc.)
- Add a start page with options the user can change before beginning the game
  - Add an option for the user to change the number of images they are tested on (currently it tests all the images so if there are 300 you will have to go through all 300 to      reach the end)
  - Once species categories are added, add an option to let the user choose what category they are tested on (dropdown list of all available categories)
- Fix download_species_images.py to be able to automate downloading images
